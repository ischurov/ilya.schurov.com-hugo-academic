I'm a mathematician, ML researcher, and technology enthusiast. I love pure mathematics, and I equally enjoy coding and solving applied problems. This dual passion allows me to contribute meaningfully across disciplines, in both academia and industry.  

Currently, I work at [Omnifold](https://omnifold.ai), where we use AI and mathematical modeling for forecasting and optimization. Previously, I was a researcher at Radboud University and an associate professor at HSE University, working on projects spanning [differential equations](/tag/differential-equations), [physics](/tag/physics), [game theory](/tag/game-theory), [biology](/tag/biology), and [linguistics](/tag/linguistics).

Iâ€™ve taught university courses on calculus, machine learning, differential equations, and data science. I also created several online courses for Coursera on the foundations of machine learning and authored [free interactive textbooks](#textbooks) on calculus and ordinary differential equations, used by thousands of Russian-speaking students.
