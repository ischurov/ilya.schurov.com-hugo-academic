I'm a mathematician and technology enthusiast. Since 2010 I work as an associate
professor at HSE University, where I am participating in various research
projects with topics ranging from [differential equations](/tag/differential-equations) 
and [physics](/tag/physics) to [game theory](/tag/game-theory) to 
[linguistics](/tag/linguistics). I love pure mathematics and I equally love to code and solve
applied problems. Currently I'm looking for opportunities to apply my
broad mathematical background, including dynamical systems, geometry and
topology, to data analysis. My teaching experience include courses on calculus,
machine learning, differential equations and data science. I prepared several
online courses for Coursera devoted to foundations of machine learning and wrote
[free interactive textbooks](#textbooks) on calculus and ordinary differential equations that
are used by thousands Russian-speaking students.
