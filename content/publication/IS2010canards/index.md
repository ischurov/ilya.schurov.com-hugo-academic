abstract: |
    In generic fast-slow systems with a single parameter on the two-dimensional
    torus, for arbitrarily small values of this parameter there exist attracting
    canard cycles. This is a key distinction between the dynamics on the torus
    and the dynamics of similar systems on the plane. This has already been
    proved for systems with a convex slow curve. This paper looks at systems
    with a nonconvex slow curve. Upper and lower estimates for the number of
    canard cycles are obtained. An open set of systems having a preassigned
    number of attracting canard cycles is constructed.
