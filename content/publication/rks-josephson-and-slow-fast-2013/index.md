abstract: |
    In order to model the processes taking place in systems with Josephson
    contacts, a differential equation on a torus with three parameters is used.
    One of the parameters of the system can be considered small and the methods
    of the fast—slow systems theory can be applied. The properties of the
    phase—lock areas — the subsets in the parameter space, in which the changing
    of a current doesn't affect the voltage — are important in practical
    applications. The phase-lock areas coincide with the Arnold tongues of a
    Poincare map along the period. A description of the limit properties of
    Arnold tongues is given. It is shown that the parameter space is split into
    certain areas, where the tongues have different geometrical structures due
    to fast—slow effects. An efficient algorithm for the calculation of tongue
    borders is elaborated. The statement concerning the asymptotic approximation
    of borders by Bessel functions is announced.
