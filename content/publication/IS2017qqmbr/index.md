abstract: We present qqmbr, novel publishing system aimed at preparation of high-quality
  mathematical publications. One source can be converted to a single interactive webpage,
  multi-page website or PDF (via LaTeX). The markup language behind qqmbr entitled
  indentml is designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable (easily parsable).
  It is possible to extend basic qqmbr markup with custom tags that enrich its semantics
  and build plugins and applications that query qqmbr documents, extract information
  from them and process it in an arbitrary way without much effort.
