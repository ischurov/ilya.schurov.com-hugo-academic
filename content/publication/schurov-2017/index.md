abstract: "Slow-fast systems on the two-torus are studied. As it was shown before,\
  \ canard cycles are generic in such systems, which is in drastic contrast with the\
  \ planar case. It is known that if the rotation number of the Poincarémap is an\
  \ integer and the slow curve is connected, the number of canard limit cycles is\
  \ bounded from above by the number of fold points of the slow curve. In the present\
  \ paper, it is proved that there are no such geometric constraints for non-integer\
  \ rotation numbers: it is possible to construct a generic system with ’as simple\
  \ as possible’ slow curve and arbitrary many limit cycles."
