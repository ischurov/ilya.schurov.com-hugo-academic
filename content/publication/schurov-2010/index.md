abstract: We show that there exist generic slow-fast systems with only one (time-scaling)
  parameter on the two-torus, which have canard cycles for arbitrary small values
  of this parameter. This is in drastic contrast with the planar case, where canards
  usually occur in two-parametric families. Here we treat systems with a convex slow
  curve. In this case there is a set of parameter values accumulating to zero for
  which the system has exactly one attracting and one repelling canard cycle. The
  basin of the attracting cycle is almost the whole torus.
