abstract: 'An estimate is found for the number of limit cycles arising from polycycles in generic finite-parameter families of differential equations on the two-sphere. It is proved that if the polycycles have a fixed number of singular points and all the singular points are elementary, then an estimate of cyclicity holds true, which is polynomial in the number of parameters of the family.'
