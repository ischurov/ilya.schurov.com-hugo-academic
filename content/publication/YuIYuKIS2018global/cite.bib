 abstract = {
    We construct an open set of structurally unstable three parameter families whose weak and so called moderate topological classification defined below has a numerical invariant that may take an arbitrary positive value.
    Here and below “families” are “families of vector fields in the two-sphere”.
    This result disproves an Arnold's conjecture of 1985.
    Then we construct an open set of six parameter families whose moderate topological classification has a functional invariant.
    This invariant is an arbitrary germ of a smooth map $(ℝ_+, a)→(ℝ_+, b)$.
    More generally, for any positive integers $d$ and $d'$, we construct an open set of families whose topological classification has a germ of a smooth map $\left(ℝ_+^d, a\right)→\left(ℝ_+^{d'}, b\right)$ as an invariant.
    Any smooth germ of this kind may be realized as such an invariant.
    These results open a new perspective of the global bifurcation theory in the two sphere.
    This perspective is discussed at the end of the paper.},
