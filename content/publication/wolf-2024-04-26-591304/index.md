abstract: Bacterial and archaeal genomes encompass numerous operons that typically
  consist of two to five genes. On larger scales, however, gene order is poorly conserved
  through the evolution of prokaryotes. Nevertheless, non-random localization of different
  classes of genes on prokaryotic chromosomes could reflect important functional and
  evolutionary constraints. We explored the patterns of genomic localization of evolutionarily
  conserved (ancient) and variable (young) genes across the diversity of bacteria
  and archaea. Nearly all bacterial and archaeal chromosomes were found to encompass
  large segments of 100â€“300 kb that were significantly enriched in either ancient
  or young genes. Similar clustering of genes with lethal knockout phenotype (essential
  genes) was observed as well. Mathematical modeling of genome evolution suggests
  that this long-range gene clustering in prokaryotic chromosomes reflects perpetual
  genome rearrangement driven by a combination of selective and neutral processes
  rather than evolutionary conservation.
